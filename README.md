# AI in the Archive: a Computational Film Analysis of Jim Hubbard's AIDS Activist Videos

In my master’s thesis I conduct a computational film analysis using Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Generative Artificial Intelligence tools and methods.   Among those is the Distant Viewing Toolkit by Taylor Arnold and Lauren Tilton, OpenCV and Gemini 1.5 pro. 

The notebook “Film_Analysis_(Elegy in the Streets)” contains the Python code for the film analysis that I run on each of the films. The film Elegy in the Streets (1989) serves as a muster example and I extensively refer to it in Chapter 4 of my thesis. 

The notebook “Final_Result_Analysis” contains the Python code for the overall analysis conducted on the final results. This includes the exploratory data analysis, the statistical analysis and the text analysis.
